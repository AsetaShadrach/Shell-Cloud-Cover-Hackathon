# Shell.ai Hackathon for Sustainable and Affordable Energy

Tackling climate change is an urgent challenge. Shell is transforming to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society and our customers. We are exploring new opportunities to provide more low-carbon energy such as biofuels, hydrogen, charging for electric vehicles and electricity generated by solar and wind power. To achieve this, we are working collaboratively on unproven, early-stage ideas with the potential to impact the future of energy.

Help us harness the power of the sun and win monetary awards or funding for your project!
