# Shell.ai Hackathon for Sustainable and Affordable Energy

Tackling climate change is an urgent challenge. Shell is transforming to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society and our customers. We are exploring new opportunities to provide more low-carbon energy such as biofuels, hydrogen, charging for electric vehicles and electricity generated by solar and wind power. To achieve this, we are working collaboratively on unproven, early-stage ideas with the potential to impact the future of energy.

Help us harness the power of the sun and win monetary awards or funding for your project!

The first round of the competition didn't exactly require you to use the images. Atleast from how I understood the objective. The second round definietly did(limited to startups i think and maybe some individuals). 

That's why the .py files have functions to convert the images to arrays and finally into one CSV.

The date retrieval and conversion functions were however used.
